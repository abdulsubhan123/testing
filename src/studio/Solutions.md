>Create a Solutions

To locate and work with just the components youâ€™ve customized, create a solution and do all your customization there. Then, always remember to work in the context of the custom solution as you add, edit, and create components. This makes it easy to export your solution so that it can be backed up or imported to another environment.

>Export Solution

You can manually export solutions using the steps in this article. We recommend that you create an unmanaged solution to use for exporting your customizations, and then export your customizations periodically so that you have a backup in case anything happens. You can't export managed solutions or the Default Solution.


>Import Solution
